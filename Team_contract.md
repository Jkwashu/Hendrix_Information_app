##Hendrix Tours App Team Contract

## Henry Spayde - Client Interfacer
My primary role is to contact the client and interact with them to benefit both our understanding and the client's understanding of the purpose and direction, as well as current status, of the app.
I will be contacting the client to set up meetings, inform them of major issues or changes from the original plan, or ask for input on new ideas or modifications.
Throughout the project, I will cooperate and communicate with my teammates and strive to create the best project possible.
If any conflicts arise, I will talk and work through them with my team, or consult Dr. Goadrich if that does not resolve the conflict.

## Joseph Washum - Integration Tester
My primary role is to test the integration of our app’s components to ensure they work together seamlessly, identifying and addressing compatibility issues.
I will use test-driven development and beta testing feedback to analyze app functionality, validate that integrated features meet the client’s requirements, and contribute to high-quality iterations. 
Throughout the project, I will collaborate closely with my teammates to align our work with the client’s vision and create a polished app ready for deployment. 
If challenges arise, I will discuss and resolve them with my team or consult Dr. Goadrich if needed.
