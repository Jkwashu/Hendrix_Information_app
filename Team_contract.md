# Hendrix Tours App Team Contract
## Team Expectations:
**Meeting Often** - We will be meeting once a week on Tuesday's

**Working Togother** - We will be communicating and asking for help/clarification from each other.
We will also be making big decisions together.

**Being Responsible** - We will each be timely with our responsibilities and seek help or clarification if needed.

## Henry Spayde - Client Interfacer
My primary role is to contact the client and interact with them to benefit both our understanding and the client's understanding of the purpose and direction, as well as current status, of the app.
I will be contacting the client to set up meetings, inform them of major issues or changes from the original plan, or ask for input on new ideas or modifications.
Throughout the project, I will cooperate and communicate with my teammates and strive to create the best project possible.
If any conflicts arise, I will talk and work through them with my team, or consult Dr. Goadrich if that does not resolve the conflict.

## Jake Nurkin - Beta Test Organizer
My primary role is to manage the beta testing for our app and evaluate user feedback through A/B testing.
I will meet with my team to make sure that we have our app ready with two different versions of app interface to be tested on. 
I will also create a feedback form via Google Forms to evaluate usability, functionality, clarity, aesthetics, and other factors for our app using a Likert scale and freeform questions. 
Using the data gained from the form, I will create a report that highlights strengths and weaknesses of the prototype, details a conclusion for the direction of the app interface based on testing, and describes the next steps for our app, working towards a final prototype. 
I will discuss with my teammates the findings from the testing which we will use to decide a timeline for completing the rest of our app. 

## Joseph Washum - Integration Tester
My primary role is to test the integration of our app’s components to ensure they work together seamlessly, identifying and addressing compatibility issues.
I will use test-driven development and beta testing feedback to analyze app functionality, validate that integrated features meet the client’s requirements, and contribute to high-quality iterations. 
Throughout the project, I will collaborate closely with my teammates to align our work with the client’s vision and create a polished app ready for deployment. 
If challenges arise, I will discuss and resolve them with my team or consult Dr. Goadrich if needed.

## Tucker Brock - Unit Tester
My primary role is to create unit tests for our app's target functionalities, ensuring that as we add new features we don't break previous ones. This requires that I also spend significant time working with each member to understand what they have implemented to ensure I understand it well enough to create unit tests for them.
Since these roles are fluid, I expect that we will each write our own unit tests for the code that we create and then my job will be to ensure they are written well and are properly formatted. To contribute to a positive team environment, I will communicate to my teammates when I make changes and I will congratulate them on their major accomplishments. 
I think the unanimous vote system will be a good way to solve conflicts.

## Henry Jackson - Task Manager
My primary role is to keep everyone on the same page to ensure that work on the project goes smoothly.
I will make sure that everyone is performing their roles as specified and I will also work to create issues on GitHub so that everyone is aware of what they should be working on and what currently needs to be done.
As the project progresses, I will constantly communicate and collaborate with my team to keep things moving forward and help deliver a well-designed project that we can all be proud of.
I will try to help resolve conflicts that arise within the team and will reach out to Dr. Goadrich whenever there is something that can't be resolved on our own.
