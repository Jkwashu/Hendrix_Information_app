# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  fonts:
      - family: Museo 
        fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Museo_Slab_300.otf
      - family: MuseoBold
        fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Museo_Slab_900.otf
      - family: Merriweather-Sans
        fonts:
          - asset: fonts/MerriweatherSans-VariableFont_wght.ttf
          - asset: fonts/MerriweatherSans-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf
            style: italic
