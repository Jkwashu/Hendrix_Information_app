# Hendrix Tours

The Hendrix Tours app allows prospective students to explore the campus, buildings, and amenities of Hendrix College from a single app. The app allows students to guide their own informational tour of Hendrix from their phones and can link them to schedule a formal tour at Hendrix if they wish. 
The look at a college that a tour provides is essential to the college search experience, so the Hendrix Tours app uses an easy to navigate interface, a  map, photos, informational videos, and comprehensive information on academics, athletics, student life, food, and housing at Hendrix.
