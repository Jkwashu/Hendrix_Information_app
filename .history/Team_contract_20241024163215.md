## Henry Spayde - Client Interfacer
My primary role is to contact the client and interact with them to benefit both our understanding and the client's understanding of the purpose and direction, as well as current status, of the app.
I will be contacting the client to set up meetings, inform them of major issues or changes from the original plan, or ask for input on new ideas or modifications.
Throughout the project, I will cooperate and communicate with my teammates and strive to create the best project possible.
If any conflicts arise, I will talk and work through them with my team, or consult Dr. Goadrich if that does not resolve the conflict.

## Jake Nurkin - Beta Test Organizer
My primary role is to manage the beta testing for our app and evaluate user feedback through A/B testing.
I will meet with my team to make sure that we have our app ready with two different versions of app interface to be tested on. 
I will also create a feedback form via Google Forms to evaluate usability, functionality, clarity, aesthetics, and other factors for our app using a Likert scale and freeform questions. 
Using the data gained from the form, I will create a report that highlights strengths and weaknesses of the prototype, details a conclusion for the direction of the app interface based on testing, and describes the next steps for our app, working towards a final prototype. 
I will discuss with my teammates the findings from the testing which we will use to decide a timeline for completing the rest of our app.
